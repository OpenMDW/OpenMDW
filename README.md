**OpenMDW License Agreement v1.0: Overview and Purpose**  
The OpenMDW License Agreement v1.0 is a draft permissive license specifically crafted for machine‑learning models and their related artifacts, collectively referred to as “Model Materials.” It aims to provide a single, easy‑to‑apply license agreement that ensures consistency and clarity across all components of an open AI model release. 

**Definitions and Scope**  
Under OpenMDW, “Model Materials” encompass one or more machine‑learning models (including architecture and parameters) along with all related artifacts—such as datasets, documentation, preprocessing and inference code, evaluation assets, and supporting tools—provided in the distribution. This inclusive definition aligns with the Model Openness Framework, covering code, data, weights, metadata, and documentation without mandating that every component be released. 

**Grant of Rights**  
Subject to compliance with the agreement’s terms, OpenMDW grants, free of charge, an unrestricted license to use, modify, distribute, and otherwise “deal in” the Model Materials under all applicable intellectual‑property regimes—including copyright, patent, database, and trade‑secret rights. This broad grant is designed to eliminate ambiguity around the legal permissions needed to work with AI assets. 

**Conditions and Attribution**  
The only substantive condition imposed by OpenMDW is preservation of the license itself: any redistribution of Model Materials must include (1) a copy of the OpenMDW Agreement and (2) all original copyright and origin notices. There are no copyleft or share‑alike requirements, ensuring that derivative works and integrations remain as unconstrained as possible.

**Patent‑Litigation Termination**  
OpenMDW incorporates a patent‑litigation‑termination clause: if a licensee initiates litigation alleging that the Model Materials infringe their patents—except as a defensive response to a suit first brought against them—all granted rights under OpenMDW are terminated. This provision serves to discourage aggressive patent actions that could undermine open collaboration.

**Outputs and Disclaimers**  
Critically, OpenMDW clarifies that any outputs generated by using the Model Materials are entirely free of license restrictions or obligations—a distinction often absent in traditional software licenses. Moreover, the license disclaims all warranties and liabilities “to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law,” placing responsibility for due diligence and rights clearance squarely on the licensee.

**Implementation, Compatibility, and Conformance**  
Implementation of OpenMDW is straightforward: a single `LICENSE` file placed at the root of the repository suffices. The license is explicitly designed to be compatible with the Model Openness Framework and to conform to the Open Source Definition—offering a permissive alternative that bridges gaps left by software‑focused licenses like MIT or Apache 2.0.
